  <p class="font text">Jana Sena or Jana Sena Party (JSP) (transl. People's Army Party)[5] is an Indian political party based in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It was founded by Telugu film star Pawan Kalyan on 14 March 2014.[6]

Formation
On 12 March 2014, Pawan Kalyan submitted the application to register the party name.[7] Kalyan formally launched the party at the HITEC City business district in Madhapur, Hyderabad, on 14 March with a massive meeting.[6][8] This was followed by another public gathering and meeting in Vizag where he launched his book Ism. The party was approved by the Election Commission on 11 December 2014.[9]

Ideology
The main goal of Jana Sena is to question any type of corruption in government functioning and organizations and to protect basic rights of people. JSP follows 7 basic ideals promoted as Ideals of JanaSena (JanaSena Sidhanthalu in Telugu):

Social consciousness without caste
Politics without religious discrimination
Reverence for linguistic diversity
Protection of our traditions and culture
Nationalism without neglecting regional aspirations
Relentless fight against corruption
Progress that preserves the environment
However, there has been confusion around Jana Sena Party's political philosophy. Despite likening himself to Che Guevara and choosing a red star as his party’s symbol, Pawan Kalyan supported BJP in 2014 elections. Later, he lashed out at BJP government at the Centre for not granting Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh.[10] Again, Jana Sena Party officially entered into an alliance with BJP in January 2020.</p>
